# Contrast Equalization
Improves the quality of an "image" by spreading the number of pixels across a range of intensity values through the utilization of a binary search tree.

# Input 
User enters number of rows and columns for the grid of their "image" and then enters pixel intensity values that will make up the "image". 

# Output
The height and number of nodes in the BST is displayed. An intensity histogram that contains the pixel's intensity range, the number of pixels in that range, and a marker for each 20 pixels (with ceiling funtion) is also displayed. Lastly, the image's dimesions and new intensity values are displayed.
